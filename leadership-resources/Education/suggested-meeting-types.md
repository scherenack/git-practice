We have an assortment of meetup that can be delivered in most languages bascially Out of the Box. 

#### Suggested Meetup Types
1. Beginner's Night (Install Party!)
  - By the end of the night, everyone should have 100% of the tools they need on their computer to be a professional developer
2. Beginner's Night (Coding basics)
  - Getting started is hard! At a night like this, we teach beginners `Hello World`, Recursion, or whatever you think they might need
2. Demo Night/Tech Talk 
  - Lead(s) or(and) participant(s) gives a talk(s) about cool things they're working on
4. Crash other meetups
  - eg, Let's get 20 of us to go to DC Python together
5. Get a job / Linkedin Updates
  - We all meet together and update our LinkedIn + talk about interviews and other things we've needed in getting jobs
6. Happy Hour
7. "How do you google for language X", "How to read the docs"
  - more than half of software development can be just reading the docs and searching google. It's a skill that we can teach!
8. Intro to Git for Language X
  - Our goal is to have a weekly Git tutorial, rotating across our meetups. We want to be Git evangelists
9. Virtual coding sessions/Office Hours
  - Sometimes it's easier if we just meet online and not in person. These can be especially helpful if we have mentors who live in Ashburn or Berlin or something.
10. Tech talk planning sessions
  - Every one of our members can talk about some technical area. This workshop is a how-to as well as a planning + reviewing platform.
11. Popular Speakers
  - Where we pick a topic and invite a speaker to present for us
12. Conference recap 
  - people go to large conferences and talk about lessons learned / we show some recorded talks
13. Code Review
  - having prepared ahead of time, one or more members present and walk through (a section of) their code. This will allow less experienced coders to learn and experienced coders the space to improve their code.
  - this event differs from **3** (Demo Night) because this event will have a facilitated conversation between the person presenting code and the people reviewing the code (aka everyone else), where Demos are typically less conversational
