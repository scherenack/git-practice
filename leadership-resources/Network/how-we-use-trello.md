# How We Use Trello

Women Who Code DC is a network of the global [Women Who Code](www.womenwhocode.com) non-profit. We have held over 200 meetups in 1.5 years and have grown to over 2300 members (as of September 2015). We are a fully volunteer based team, so that means any and all of this work comes around the awesome day jobs we all have. With that comes a lot of nuances and learning experiences that we hope can help other groups with a similar dynamic!

We have gone through a lot of iterations as we have tried to organize our team over the past 1.5 years. For the start, we relied solely on Google Drive - but often ran into issues of leads not being able to find the information we needed them to know. Whether this is inherently google drive's issue, or a lack of communication/coordination on our team is outstanding. Our biggest issue with Google Drive was the terrible user experience with discovering documentation created by other people.

With that in mind, and as we were transitioning from a leadership team of around 4-6, to 15-20 women, we began experimenting with what else could work. We tried trello in December 2014, abandoned it in January 2015, and have been back to using it since July 2015. Hopefully this works!

The primary purpose of this document is to educate our leadership team, but we hope that this may help other meetup groups in the future.

With a volunteer group, we don't have an office that everyone comes into - and a lot of our leads work autonomously from the rest of the leadership team. That brings a challenge where often leads don't know who everyone else is! This board strives to be a start for putting names to faces and what they do. Each card lists the role of the member and allows for our team to comment if they ideas for new things to work on!

We also have a powerpoint where each lead fills out a slide to showcase who they are and what they do. This is most useful for sending to other networks in WWC or the general public that might be interested in who all is helping out!

## Calendar

This will hopefully be our most helpful feature of Trello. With so many events there comes a need for a lot of coordination and balancing what happens on what night, who is hosting us, who is attending, etc. We attempted to use a Google Sheet for this, and would have a line per event. Then we could use Slack to discuss everything. The issue with this is that threaded converstaions in Slack don't yet exist. So we would often see conversations where one person would be talking about X event, and another person would be talking about Y event, and that always lead to a fair amount of confusion. Having a view of every event, with options to comment, upload attachments, and assign leads to work on the events, is a huge step forward for us.

The calendar view is particularly helpful! With the ability to filter cards by meetup type, or by member involved (great for filtering to only see your events), we are hoping to have a lot easier time keeping everyone on the same page!
