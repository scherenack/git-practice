# Possible Ideas based on Slack talk: 

## Mean Stack: 
Spend each evening focused on one part of the stack, starting from the bottom up. Finish on Angular.

## Frameworks Series: 
Do a basic rundown of a popular framework once the MEAN stack stuff is done. We’ll focus only on the most popular frameworks and those that show interest among members.

## Javascript Toolbelt - Testing and Setup Series:
How to use tools like Yeoman, Create.js and Bower to setup your projects and other tools like Grunt, Gulp, Jasmine, and JSLint to test large multi-component projects.
