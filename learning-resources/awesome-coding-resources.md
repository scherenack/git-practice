### Intro to Coding

* [Coding Intro](http://codingintro.com/) - An introduction to programming in a couple of hours. A great place to start and see what all of the coding fuss is about! It is split up into a couple of chapters with coding exercises for you to complete on your own. 
* [Why Learning to Code is So Damn Hard](http://www.vikingcodeschool.com/posts/why-learning-to-code-is-so-damn-hard) - One of the absolute best "learning to code" articles of all time. 

### Full Stack

* [27 Pieces of Advice for Full Stack Developers](https://www.talentbuddy.co/blog/27-pieces-of-advice-for-full-stack-developers/) - Mildly javascript focused (ok pretty JS focused) but if you can get past that, awesome advice! We're true believers in **#20: Donâ€™t belittle other languages or approaches just to make yourself feel like a loyal member of whatever technology community-of-the-moment.**
* [Free Lynda access with DC MLK Library Card!](http://dclibrary.org/node/46352) - not much explanation needed here, this is as good as it gets!
